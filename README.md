## Dataset
This dataset is a combination of:
* Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K)
* Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC)
* Real-world Task-driven Testing Set (RTTS)
* Detection in Adverse Weather Nature (DAWN)

Designed for training and evaluating **YOLO-based vehicle detection models** in diverse conditions, including adverse weather. The dataset is ~12 GB and released under CC-BY-4.0.

### Classes and Annotations
This dataset focuses exclusively on **vehicle detection**. All non-vehicle classes have been removed.  
The remaining classes are:
- Bicycle (Bike)
- Car
- Motorcycle (Motorbike)
- Bus
- Train
- Truck

All annotations have been **converted to YOLO format**, making the dataset directly usable for YOLO-based training and evaluation.
